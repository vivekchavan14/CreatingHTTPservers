# CreatingHTTPservers

This repository contains an example Node.js application that demonstrates the usage of an HTTP server to calculate the sum of numbers up to a specified counter value.

- The index.js file contains the main application logic for the HTTP server.
- The calculateSum function calculates the sum of numbers up to a specified counter value.
- The handleRequest function handles incoming HTTP requests and calculates the sum using the calculateSum function.
- The server listens on port 3011 and responds to requests to the /handle route.
- The secondProcess.js file demonstrates how to fetch data from the server using the Fetch API.
- The callBackFn function processes the response and logs the JSON body.
